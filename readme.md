# 2. Assume opponent goes first, by marking an X in one of the spaces:
#    2.1 If opponent goes in the center space, then place an O in
#        the top left space
#    2.2 Else if opponent goes anywhere else, place an O in the
#        center
# 3. Repeat the following steps until the board is filled:
#    3.1 Opponent will place another X in one of the remaining empty
#        spaces
#    3.2 If any two of opponent's X's are in line with each other
#        and an open space remains on that line, place an O in
#        that remaining space to block (prevent opponent from
#        winning the game)
#    3.3 Else if first O was placed in center and any center space
#        (top center, left center, etc.) remains open, place an
#        O in a center space that will cause the opponent to
#        have to block
#    3.4 Else if first O was placed in corner and any corner space
#        remains open, place an O in a corner space that will
#        cause the opponent to have to block
#    3.5 Otherwise, place an O in any remaining open space
